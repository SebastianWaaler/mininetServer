To run the server:
"python3 server.py"

To run the client script: 
"python3 client.py -i 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 -f index.html"

I encountered som errors while trying to get the server running on mininet in virtualbox. I managed to get the files to the vm as well as the simpletopo.py file. I placed an image of where i got stuck in the assignment folder.
